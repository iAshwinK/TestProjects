The hierarchy of precedence given to each of following primitive data type.
If data type cannot be casted to anything other than given data type next to each data type.
ex:
for float:
		float --> double
(in this case you can't pass float to long/int/short/byte/char as it's not given, you can try it out)

for constant:
		int --> long --> float --> double
for char:
		char --> int --> long --> float --> double
for byte:
		byte --> short --> int --> long --> float --> double
for short:
		shot --> int --> long --> float --> double
for int:
		int --> long --> float --> double
for long:
		long --> float --> double
for float:
		float --> double
for double:
		double
